The stock compensation, which came in the form of options at the time that I joined, is calculated based on the # of options * (preferred share valuation at the time I joined - strike price). The company's valuation when I joined was $2.2B; it has since raised a couple rounds at $4.4B and $6.4B that have raised the valuation. I received a counteroffer when I left the company that would have brought my base up to 195k and equity (combination of options+RSUs) that would have worked out to ~100k, for a TC of ~295k."
